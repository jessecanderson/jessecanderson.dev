## Here we GO again?

Over the last month, I decided I wanted to learn Go Lang. So, I figured a good place to start was working on a framework in Go that did static site generation. So I stumbled upon [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and decided to migrate everything over and finally get my domain/website up and running again.

So here it is! The new and improved(?) Hugo based blog! Welcome to **jessecanderson.dev**.

Going to be working on my Markdown skills, posting more tutorials, trying to get back into the swing of things.

Wish me luck!
