## Welcome Back

So, it has been a <b>WHILE</b> since I posted anything to this blog. The last couple of years I have just lost motivation and direction. I've kind of floated through doing my job and not really building skills as deeply as I once did. So, with the new year here and me trying to work on my motivation I'm going to start a new series. I'm going to call it <b>Starting Flutter!</b> and I hope this will be an ongoing series of interesting Flutter topics.

This maybe the series depending on how it goes:

- break down the Flutter framework for mobile developers.
- Installing Flutter and Dart (macOS)
- Dart basics
- Flutter basics
- First applications in Flutter.

Then I hope to jump into more advanced topics over the next year or so.

## Why Flutter

"Why Flutter?" I hear you ask? Well, as an iOS developer I was super hesitent to do anything outside the Apple ecosystem. But after almost two years of working in Flutter I've come to like it. It's not native development by any means, but it is very slick on how they do things and what you can do inside Flutter. This will not only help me share my understanding of Flutter but ALSO help me grow as a more advanced Flutter developer.

So, let us go on this journy together as I try and help you put together Flutter apps for iOS and Android and then look at all the other deployment options we have.

Looking forward to getting these written and pushed out to everyone and I hope you find them somewhat useful.
