## Who am I?

My name is Jesse. I'm a father, husband, and self taught developer. I started my journey as an iOS mobile developer but have since added a bunch of things to my toolbelt. I'm a lover of learning, sharing of information, and always trying to push myself to learn something else.

## I hope you have a great day!
