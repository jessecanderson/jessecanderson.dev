This amazing {personal} theme I found really hits what I want in my layout. I&rsquo;m not a great developer (working on that) so building my own blog platform wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted to try and tackle when there were so many other options out there. This platform really works for what I want to do.</p><p>So here is the deal, I work in infrastructure. I touch a LOT of different technologies and am able to implement solutions for customers that really make a difference. I&rsquo;ve been digging into infrastructure as code and configuration management solutions over the last year and have now found myself head down in Chef. I want to post things on Chef, NetApp, Cisco, Puppet, and whatever else I want to touch on. This will be my new home for all of this as well as whatever else I feel like posting.</p><p>I have a couple of posts that I&rsquo;m working on. I owe one for NetApp Insight that happened last month and I&rsquo;m working on a DevOps focused one. I have a &ldquo;Chef on Raspberry Pi&rdquo; post that I want to do documenting the pains I had getting Ruby updated on my Pi and getting that thing bootstrapped. All of this is coming.</p><p>Let me know what you think of my new blog home. I&rsquo;m going to be growing it over the next year with iOS, Chef, NetApp, and Cisco stuffs. I&rsquo;m also going to be showing my GitHub repositories some much needed love. Hoping I can come up with something useful.</p><p>~Jesse</p></content><p><a href=http://jessecanderson.dev/blog/personal/>#personal</a>
