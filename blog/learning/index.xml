Over the last month, I decided I wanted to learn Go Lang. So, I figured a good place to start was working on a framework in Go that did static site generation. So I stumbled upon Hugo and decided to migrate everything over and finally get my domain/website up and running again.
So here it is! The new and improved(?) Hugo based blog! Welcome to jessecanderson.dev.</description></item><item><title>Starting Flutter</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/starting-flutter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/starting-flutter/</guid><description>Welcome Back So, it has been a WHILE since I posted anything to this blog. The last couple of years I have just lost motivation and direction. I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of floated through doing my job and not really building skills as deeply as I once did. So, with the new year here and me trying to work on my motivation I&amp;rsquo;m going to start a new series. I&amp;rsquo;m going to call it Starting Flutter!</description></item><item><title>Fall has come to Florida</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/fall-has-come-to-florida/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/fall-has-come-to-florida/</guid><description>Welcome to fall in the great state of Florida. It has been a really busy summer for us. Not only did we stay home, just trying to do our part to help with this global pandemic that we are going through, but work has been a super whirlwind of&amp;hellip;.well&amp;hellip;.work.
We have been making great progress on our app, and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a TON about Flutter and Dart over the summer. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% on the Flutter train myself, I still have some issues with differences between it and Swift/SwiftUI, but it has been a great learning experiance.</description></item><item><title>2019 in Review</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/2019-in-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2019 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/2019-in-review/</guid><description>I saw a challange on LinkedIn that said instead of trying to predict technologies for the next year, make sure to do a year in review post to your blog that shows off your accomplishments for 2019. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not great at tooting my own horn here. I have struggled over the last couple of years on how best to showcase any accomplishment that I have made. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to REALLY try and showcase something today to review my last year.</description></item><item><title>Life Update</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/life-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/life-update/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months since my last update. So here we go!
We are very close to our inital launch of an application written native in iOS and Android. I built out the iOS application and my office mate built out the Android application. It was a LOT of fun to build these out, and I learned a bunch while building it. I think this sets us up for adding some cool features in the near future.</description></item><item><title>Small Goals</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/small-goals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/small-goals/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got news, and it&amp;rsquo;s good and hoping that it will be good for my poor neglected blog as well.
As people here are well aware, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get into iOS development really hard over the last year. During the last two months I&amp;rsquo;ve applied to dozens of iOS developer positions across the country looking for someone who would take a chance on me. My constraint was I needed to be able to keep my family here.</description></item><item><title>Am I Intermediate?</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/am-i-intermediate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/am-i-intermediate/</guid><description>As many of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through Treehouse in the Techdegree program to learn iOS development. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to &amp;ldquo;become&amp;rdquo; an iOS or mobile developer for a number of years and have put a LOT of time and effort into learning Swift and how to develop apps for the Apple ecosystem.
Recently, I was able to successfully pass project #3. I am very excited and proud of the progress I have made in the program and I feel this is a good step in rebuilding myself after the events of the last month.</description></item><item><title>Let us build a button</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/let-us-build-a-button/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/let-us-build-a-button/</guid><description>Creating buttons in Xcode is pretty simple. You go into interface builder, you select the button, you drag it over and drop it into the storyboard, and then you connect it to the ViewController as an Outlet or an IBAction. Not a lot to it right? Well, what if you need to make a button but don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the Main.Storyboard?
It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty simple to add a button into your app by creating one and either dropping in into your UIView or adding it to a StackView.</description></item><item><title>Next Year Post Ideas</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</guid><description>Developers are rock stars. They are the people who push the hardware and systems to do things that we may never have though they could do. They design our websites, that game you play on your phone, the service that keeps track of all your calendar, contacts, and emails. They create things out of nothing through the multitude of languages that they have to learn to stay competitive. They are always pushing themselves to do more, be better, learn something, break something, and create something useful for others.</description></item><item><title>Chef on the Pi</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/chef-on-the-pi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/chef-on-the-pi/</guid><description>A few weeks back I decided to replace my older Raspberry Pi for a new Raspberry Pi 3. I had no idea what I wanted to do with this amazing board when I bought it, but I did know that I wanted to see if I could get it to bootstrap to my Chef server. This was a very interesting process and I wanted to go through all the steps for anyone else who may want to bootstrap their Raspberry Pi for whatever reason.</description></item></channel></rss>
