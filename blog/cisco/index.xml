To be totally honest, I shrugged it off as just something that was trying to get hyped up and would not have any real impact on what I do.

I guess a desire to learn and grow.</description></item><item><title>Cisco Live 2014</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/cisco-live-2014/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2014 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/cisco-live-2014/</guid><description>Well, I survived my first trip to Cisco Live.
