The last couple of years I have just lost motivation and direction. I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of floated through doing my job and not really building skills as deeply as I once did. So, with the new year here and me trying to work on my motivation I&amp;rsquo;m going to start a new series. I&amp;rsquo;m going to call it Starting Flutter!</description></item><item><title>Fall has come to Florida</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/fall-has-come-to-florida/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/fall-has-come-to-florida/</guid><description>Welcome to fall in the great state of Florida. It has been a really busy summer for us. Not only did we stay home, just trying to do our part to help with this global pandemic that we are going through, but work has been a super whirlwind of&amp;hellip;.well&amp;hellip;.work.
We have been making great progress on our app, and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a TON about Flutter and Dart over the summer. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% on the Flutter train myself, I still have some issues with differences between it and Swift/SwiftUI, but it has been a great learning experiance.</description></item><item><title>Six months a developer</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/six-months-a-developer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/six-months-a-developer/</guid><description>It has been roughly over six months since I started my latest job as a mobile developer for Oddball and I thought I would give a few thoughts on where I am and where I wanted to be.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Developer Now, the last six months have not made me a developer. No, not by a long shot. I look back now and realize I&amp;rsquo;ve been strong in this skill for years.</description></item><item><title>Next Year Post Ideas</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</guid><description>So, I wrote done some ideas for the year. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with a few topics to help get myself back into things. These should keep me pretty busy over the next few months.
These should give me a few months worth of materials to work on. But let me get into why I am looking at these specifically.
It&amp;rsquo;s been seven or so months since Apple released SwiftUI on us and I&amp;rsquo;ve only done a little bit with this framework.</description></item><item><title>Small Goals</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/small-goals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/small-goals/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got news, and it&amp;rsquo;s good and hoping that it will be good for my poor neglected blog as well.
As people here are well aware, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get into iOS development really hard over the last year. During the last two months I&amp;rsquo;ve applied to dozens of iOS developer positions across the country looking for someone who would take a chance on me. My constraint was I needed to be able to keep my family here.</description></item><item><title>Am I Intermediate?</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/am-i-intermediate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/am-i-intermediate/</guid><description>As many of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through Treehouse in the Techdegree program to learn iOS development. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to &amp;ldquo;become&amp;rdquo; an iOS or mobile developer for a number of years and have put a LOT of time and effort into learning Swift and how to develop apps for the Apple ecosystem.
Recently, I was able to successfully pass project #3. I am very excited and proud of the progress I have made in the program and I feel this is a good step in rebuilding myself after the events of the last month.</description></item><item><title>Hackathon01</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/hackathon01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/hackathon01/</guid><description>What a great weekend I had. This last Saturday (2 Dec. 2017) I participated in my first Hackathon! I have to say it was an eye opening experience and one that I really want to do again. Let me give a breakdown of the day that I had.
My First Hackathon The event started at 9am so I arrived at ~8:30am just to make sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t late and could get settled and all of that.</description></item><item><title>Keeping On</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/keeping-on/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/keeping-on/</guid><description>Ok, I&amp;rsquo;ve been really quiet for a LONG time. My last post was in way back in February and I feel bad about that. I had been doing so good at posting pretty consistently towards the end of last year and then I just dropped off. I&amp;rsquo;m sure some people (not many people I don&amp;rsquo;t think) are wondering what happened to me? Where did I go? What did I do?</description></item><item><title>Back in the groove!</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/back-in-the-groove/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/back-in-the-groove/</guid><description>Good day! And welcome. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote anything new, and I do apologize for that. December what a busy month and then January and I think I actually burned myself out a bit with all that I was trying to do. I would spend my days working on our cloud deployment process and on-boarding customers or ingesting customer data onto our NetApp arrays. I was building out DR testing plans and scripts to use for each customers DR test and validating it worked.</description></item><item><title>Case for a Switch</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/case-for-a-switch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/case-for-a-switch/</guid><description>Working on Swift, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a pretty cool little thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing If/else statementsfor checking conditionals for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the first things that anyone covers for flow control. You check to see if something is true or not and then act upon that check. Else you can do something different. But going into massive checks for lots of conditionals can be an eye sore.
You can also string together multiple If/Else if/Elsestatements for more complex checks:</description></item><item><title>Respect your language</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/respect-your-language/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/respect-your-language/</guid><description>Before I take off for the rest of the week, I wanted to talk about something that I overheard during a conversation about development languages.
&amp;ldquo;I work in language &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo; because it is awesome. That other language sucks.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, ya? Well there is this other language that is worse then that, and those guys are elitist so they all suck.&amp;rdquo;
Let me ask, what is wrong with the statements above?</description></item><item><title>Commitmas</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/commitmas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/commitmas/</guid><description>With this journey into development, I have been exposed to many different tools that help developers create their code and manage that code.
IDE&amp;rsquo;s Package management tools Frameworks Repositories It&amp;rsquo;s this last one I really wanted to focus on. Repositories are places to hold your code as well as keep different versions of your code. These are tracked by who uploads the code, what has changed, and a complete history of what has changed.</description></item></channel></rss>
