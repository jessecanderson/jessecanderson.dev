It has been a really busy summer for us. Not only did we stay home, just trying to do our part to help with this global pandemic that we are going through, but work has been a super whirlwind of&amp;hellip;.well&amp;hellip;.work.
We have been making great progress on our app, and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a TON about Flutter and Dart over the summer. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% on the Flutter train myself, I still have some issues with differences between it and Swift/SwiftUI, but it has been a great learning experiance.</description></item><item><title>2019 in Review</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/2019-in-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2019 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/2019-in-review/</guid><description>I saw a challange on LinkedIn that said instead of trying to predict technologies for the next year, make sure to do a year in review post to your blog that shows off your accomplishments for 2019. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not great at tooting my own horn here. I have struggled over the last couple of years on how best to showcase any accomplishment that I have made. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to REALLYtry and showcase something today to review my last year.</description></item><item><title>Life Update</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/life-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/life-update/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months since my last update. So here we go!
We are very close to our inital launch of an application written native in iOS and Android. I built out the iOS application and my office mate built out the Android application. It was a LOT of fun to build these out, and I learned a bunch while building it. I think this sets us up for adding some cool features in the near future.</description></item><item><title>Overstressed</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/overstressed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/overstressed/</guid><description>I have been a Solution Architect at AWS for just over 10 months now and during that time I have pushed myself to learn two skills at the same time.
First, AWS. Coming from a more traditional background, learning AWS and how things are architected in the cloud was an amazing challenge. I&amp;rsquo;m no expert by any means, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned SO much over the last few months on cloud, cloud compute, different design patterns, and always planing for failure.</description></item><item><title>Back in the groove!</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/back-in-the-groove/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/back-in-the-groove/</guid><description>Good day! And welcome. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote anything new, and I do apologize for that. December what a busy month and then January and I think I actually burned myself out a bit with all that I was trying to do. I would spend my days working on our cloud deployment process and on-boarding customers or ingesting customer data onto our NetApp arrays. I was building out DR testing plans and scripts to use for each customers DR test and validating it worked.</description></item><item><title>Getting Setup</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/getting-setup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/getting-setup/</guid><description>After playing with this over the last few days, I really like the setup that I have found. This amazing {personal} theme I found really hits what I want in my layout. I&amp;rsquo;m not a great developer (working on that) so building my own blog platform wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I wanted to try and tackle when there were so many other options out there. This platform really works for what I want to do.</description></item><item><title>New Blog</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/new-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/new-blog/</guid><description>Just a quick update. I have a new home for my blog! I will be using the GitHub Pages feature and build off my GitHub account. I hope to have a custom URL at some point, but that is down the road. Enjoy the new home of my blog and maybe I can keep it up more! :wink:</description></item></channel></rss>
