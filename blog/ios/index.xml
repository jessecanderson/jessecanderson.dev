I&amp;rsquo;m a Developer Now, the last six months have not made me a developer. No, not by a long shot. I look back now and realize I&amp;rsquo;ve been strong in this skill for years.</description></item><item><title>Let us build a button</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/let-us-build-a-button/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/let-us-build-a-button/</guid><description>Creating buttons in Xcode is pretty simple. You go into interface builder, you select the button, you drag it over and drop it into the storyboard, and then you connect it to the ViewController as an Outlet or an IBAction. Not a lot to it right? Well, what if you need to make a button but don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the Main.Storyboard?
It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty simple to add a button into your app by creating one and either dropping in into your UIView or adding it to a StackView.</description></item><item><title>Case for a Switch</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/case-for-a-switch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/case-for-a-switch/</guid><description>Working on Swift, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a pretty cool little thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing If/else statementsfor checking conditionals for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the first things that anyone covers for flow control. You check to see if something is true or not and then act upon that check. Else you can do something different. But going into massive checks for lots of conditionals can be an eye sore.
You can also string together multiple If/Else if/Elsestatements for more complex checks:</description></item><item><title>Starting Projects</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/starting-projects/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/starting-projects/</guid><description>I got to my desk this morning and I looked really hard at my computer screen. I glanced at all the tabs that I had open for the different things that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to wrap my head around.
iOS - A huge motivator for me. Learning to develop for the Apple ecosystem has been a goal for many years. I spent a LOT of time this year working on that goal so I could get an app into the app store, but still not there yet.</description></item></channel></rss>
