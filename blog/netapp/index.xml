There were the new AFF platforms, all the new functionality and features included in ONTAP 9, and the list goes on. But for me, the coolest thing I saw at Insight was not necessarily demonstrated on stage (although there was a cool presentation on it, which I’ll get into later).</description></item><item><title>NetApp Insight 2015</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/netapp-insight-2015/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/netapp-insight-2015/</guid><description>NetApp Insight was a few weeks ago in Las Vegas and it was a blast. I would have had something posted sooner, but I have been recovering from the information overload and Las Vegas just gets to you at some point. I picked up some kind of black plague that I thought was going to take me out, but I am on the mend and I want to do a recap of what Insight was for me.</description></item><item><title>NetApp Insight 2014</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/netapp-insight-2014/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/netapp-insight-2014/</guid><description>Oh boy, what a week it has been. We just finished wrapping up NetApp Insight 2014 and it has been a blast! It was a whirlwind of information, learning, social activities, and hanging out with some AWESOME people. Oh, did I also mention how awesome the people were?
AWESOME!!
And when I say people, I mean everyone. This was the first year that the event was open to customers and the response was amazing.</description></item><item><title>Confessions of a NetApp Advocate</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/confessions-of-a-netapp-advocate/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2014 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/confessions-of-a-netapp-advocate/</guid><description>My name is Jesse, and I’m a NetApp Advocate. What does it mean to be a NetApp Advocate? It means I talk about NetApp so much someone at NetApp noticed and gave me a title. My company is a relatively new NetApp partner, so I actually find myself in the interesting position of advocating for NetApp not only with our customers, but with our internal teams as well.
Everyone always wants to know why I like NetApp so much.</description></item></channel></rss>
