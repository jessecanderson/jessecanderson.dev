Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not great at tooting my own horn here. I have struggled over the last couple of years on how best to showcase any accomplishment that I have made. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to REALLY try and showcase something today to review my last year.</description></item><item><title>Life Update</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/life-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/life-update/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months since my last update. So here we go!
We are very close to our inital launch of an application written native in iOS and Android. I built out the iOS application and my office mate built out the Android application. It was a LOT of fun to build these out, and I learned a bunch while building it. I think this sets us up for adding some cool features in the near future.</description></item><item><title>Small Goals</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/small-goals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/small-goals/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got news, and it&amp;rsquo;s good and hoping that it will be good for my poor neglected blog as well.
As people here are well aware, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get into iOS development really hard over the last year. During the last two months I&amp;rsquo;ve applied to dozens of iOS developer positions across the country looking for someone who would take a chance on me. My constraint was I needed to be able to keep my family here.</description></item><item><title>Am I Intermediate?</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/am-i-intermediate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/am-i-intermediate/</guid><description>As many of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through Treehouse in the Techdegree program to learn iOS development. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to &amp;ldquo;become&amp;rdquo; an iOS or mobile developer for a number of years and have put a LOT of time and effort into learning Swift and how to develop apps for the Apple ecosystem.
Recently, I was able to successfully pass project #3. I am very excited and proud of the progress I have made in the program and I feel this is a good step in rebuilding myself after the events of the last month.</description></item><item><title>Overstressed</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/overstressed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/overstressed/</guid><description>I have been a Solution Architect at AWS for just over 10 months now and during that time I have pushed myself to learn two skills at the same time.
First, AWS. Coming from a more traditional background, learning AWS and how things are architected in the cloud was an amazing challenge. I&amp;rsquo;m no expert by any means, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned SO much over the last few months on cloud, cloud compute, different design patterns, and always planing for failure.</description></item><item><title>Hackathon01</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/hackathon01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/hackathon01/</guid><description>What a great weekend I had. This last Saturday (2 Dec. 2017) I participated in my first Hackathon! I have to say it was an eye opening experience and one that I really want to do again. Let me give a breakdown of the day that I had.
My First Hackathon The event started at 9am so I arrived at ~8:30am just to make sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t late and could get settled and all of that.</description></item><item><title>Back in the groove!</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/back-in-the-groove/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/back-in-the-groove/</guid><description>Good day! And welcome. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote anything new, and I do apologize for that. December what a busy month and then January and I think I actually burned myself out a bit with all that I was trying to do. I would spend my days working on our cloud deployment process and on-boarding customers or ingesting customer data onto our NetApp arrays. I was building out DR testing plans and scripts to use for each customers DR test and validating it worked.</description></item><item><title>Respect your language</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/respect-your-language/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/respect-your-language/</guid><description>Before I take off for the rest of the week, I wanted to talk about something that I overheard during a conversation about development languages.
&amp;ldquo;I work in language &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo; because it is awesome. That other language sucks.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, ya? Well there is this other language that is worse then that, and those guys are elitist so they all suck.&amp;rdquo;
Let me ask, what is wrong with the statements above?</description></item><item><title>Movember 2016</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/movember-2016/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/movember-2016/</guid><description>This post will be pretty short I think. I just wanted to touch upon Movember for mens health.
For the last three years I have participated in Movember to help raise awareness for mens health. The first year, it was really just a reason to grow a moustache really. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the cause very seriously and didn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate what the group was really trying to do. There are a few movements in November and I admit that I got caught up in the &amp;ldquo;everyone is doing it&amp;rdquo; thing.</description></item><item><title>Impostor Syndrome</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/impostor-syndrome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/impostor-syndrome/</guid><description>I wanted to talk about something that I have been dealing with for a while. As I have shifted from technology to technology or new philosophy, I always start off as someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like they belong. Like an impostor in that technologies environment. I&amp;rsquo;m getting that feeling right now as I try and break more into the developer space. There is a phrase called &amp;ldquo;Impostor Syndrome&amp;rdquo; that I felt was a perfect description of what I felt.</description></item><item><title>Getting Setup</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/getting-setup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/getting-setup/</guid><description>After playing with this over the last few days, I really like the setup that I have found. This amazing {personal} theme I found really hits what I want in my layout. I&amp;rsquo;m not a great developer (working on that) so building my own blog platform wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I wanted to try and tackle when there were so many other options out there. This platform really works for what I want to do.</description></item><item><title>New Blog</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/new-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/new-blog/</guid><description>Just a quick update. I have a new home for my blog! I will be using the GitHub Pages feature and build off my GitHub account. I hope to have a custom URL at some point, but that is down the road. Enjoy the new home of my blog and maybe I can keep it up more! :wink:</description></item></channel></rss>
