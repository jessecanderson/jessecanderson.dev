Not all of them use the same software so I have had a chance to play with four different solutions for backup and recovery. Each solution has there strengths for sure, none of them are bad but some are stronger then others. The one I think works the most reliably is Veeam.
There are many places the highlight the benefits of Veeam for backing up or doing restores of VMware based infrastructure.</description></item></channel></rss>
