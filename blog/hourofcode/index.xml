They are the people who push the hardware and systems to do things that we may never have though they could do. They design our websites, that game you play on your phone, the service that keeps track of all your calendar, contacts, and emails. They create things out of nothing through the multitude of languages that they have to learn to stay competitive. They are always pushing themselves to do more, be better, learn something, break something, and create something useful for others.</description></item></channel></rss>
