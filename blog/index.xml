Over the last month, I decided I wanted to learn Go Lang. So, I figured a good place to start was working on a framework in Go that did static site generation. So I stumbled upon Hugo and decided to migrate everything over and finally get my domain/website up and running again.
So here it is! The new and improved(?) Hugo based blog! Welcome to jessecanderson.dev.</description></item><item><title>Starting Flutter</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/starting-flutter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/starting-flutter/</guid><description>Welcome Back So, it has been a WHILEsince I posted anything to this blog. The last couple of years I have just lost motivation and direction. I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of floated through doing my job and not really building skills as deeply as I once did. So, with the new year here and me trying to work on my motivation I&amp;rsquo;m going to start a new series. I&amp;rsquo;m going to call it Starting Flutter!</description></item><item><title>Fall has come to Florida</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/fall-has-come-to-florida/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/fall-has-come-to-florida/</guid><description>Welcome to fall in the great state of Florida. It has been a really busy summer for us. Not only did we stay home, just trying to do our part to help with this global pandemic that we are going through, but work has been a super whirlwind of&amp;hellip;.well&amp;hellip;.work.
We have been making great progress on our app, and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a TON about Flutter and Dart over the summer. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% on the Flutter train myself, I still have some issues with differences between it and Swift/SwiftUI, but it has been a great learning experiance.</description></item><item><title>Six months a developer</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/six-months-a-developer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/six-months-a-developer/</guid><description>It has been roughly over six months since I started my latest job as a mobile developer for Oddball and I thought I would give a few thoughts on where I am and where I wanted to be.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Developer Now, the last six months have not made me a developer. No, not by a long shot. I look back now and realize I&amp;rsquo;ve been strong in this skill for years.</description></item><item><title>Next Year Post Ideas</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</guid><description>So, I wrote done some ideas for the year. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with a few topics to help get myself back into things. These should keep me pretty busy over the next few months.
These should give me a few months worth of materials to work on. But let me get into why I am looking at these specifically.
It&amp;rsquo;s been seven or so months since Apple released SwiftUI on us and I&amp;rsquo;ve only done a little bit with this framework.</description></item><item><title>2019 in Review</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/2019-in-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2019 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/2019-in-review/</guid><description>I saw a challange on LinkedIn that said instead of trying to predict technologies for the next year, make sure to do a year in review post to your blog that shows off your accomplishments for 2019. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not great at tooting my own horn here. I have struggled over the last couple of years on how best to showcase any accomplishment that I have made. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to REALLYtry and showcase something today to review my last year.</description></item><item><title>Life Update</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/life-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/life-update/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months since my last update. So here we go!
We are very close to our inital launch of an application written native in iOS and Android. I built out the iOS application and my office mate built out the Android application. It was a LOT of fun to build these out, and I learned a bunch while building it. I think this sets us up for adding some cool features in the near future.</description></item><item><title>Small Goals</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/small-goals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/small-goals/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got news, and it&amp;rsquo;s good and hoping that it will be good for my poor neglected blog as well.
As people here are well aware, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get into iOS development really hard over the last year. During the last two months I&amp;rsquo;ve applied to dozens of iOS developer positions across the country looking for someone who would take a chance on me. My constraint was I needed to be able to keep my family here.</description></item><item><title>Am I Intermediate?</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/am-i-intermediate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/am-i-intermediate/</guid><description>As many of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through Treehouse in the Techdegree program to learn iOS development. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to &amp;ldquo;become&amp;rdquo; an iOS or mobile developer for a number of years and have put a LOT of time and effort into learning Swift and how to develop apps for the Apple ecosystem.
Recently, I was able to successfully pass project #3. I am very excited and proud of the progress I have made in the program and I feel this is a good step in rebuilding myself after the events of the last month.</description></item><item><title>Let us build a button</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/let-us-build-a-button/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/let-us-build-a-button/</guid><description>Creating buttons in Xcode is pretty simple. You go into interface builder, you select the button, you drag it over and drop it into the storyboard, and then you connect it to the ViewController as an Outlet or an IBAction. Not a lot to it right? Well, what if you need to make a button but don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the Main.Storyboard?
It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty simple to add a button into your app by creating one and either dropping in into your UIView or adding it to a StackView.</description></item><item><title>Overstressed</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/overstressed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/overstressed/</guid><description>I have been a Solution Architect at AWS for just over 10 months now and during that time I have pushed myself to learn two skills at the same time.
First, AWS. Coming from a more traditional background, learning AWS and how things are architected in the cloud was an amazing challenge. I&amp;rsquo;m no expert by any means, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned SO much over the last few months on cloud, cloud compute, different design patterns, and always planing for failure.</description></item><item><title>Hackathon01</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/hackathon01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/hackathon01/</guid><description>What a great weekend I had. This last Saturday (2 Dec. 2017) I participated in my first Hackathon! I have to say it was an eye opening experience and one that I really want to do again. Let me give a breakdown of the day that I had.
My First Hackathon The event started at 9am so I arrived at ~8:30am just to make sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t late and could get settled and all of that.</description></item><item><title>Keeping On</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/keeping-on/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/keeping-on/</guid><description>Ok, I&amp;rsquo;ve been really quiet for a LONG time. My last post was in way back in February and I feel bad about that. I had been doing so good at posting pretty consistently towards the end of last year and then I just dropped off. I&amp;rsquo;m sure some people (not many people I don&amp;rsquo;t think) are wondering what happened to me? Where did I go? What did I do?</description></item><item><title>Back in the groove!</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/back-in-the-groove/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/back-in-the-groove/</guid><description>Good day! And welcome. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote anything new, and I do apologize for that. December what a busy month and then January and I think I actually burned myself out a bit with all that I was trying to do. I would spend my days working on our cloud deployment process and on-boarding customers or ingesting customer data onto our NetApp arrays. I was building out DR testing plans and scripts to use for each customers DR test and validating it worked.</description></item><item><title>Case for a Switch</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/case-for-a-switch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/case-for-a-switch/</guid><description>Working on Swift, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a pretty cool little thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing If/else statementsfor checking conditionals for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the first things that anyone covers for flow control. You check to see if something is true or not and then act upon that check. Else you can do something different. But going into massive checks for lots of conditionals can be an eye sore.
You can also string together multiple If/Else if/Elsestatements for more complex checks:</description></item><item><title>Veeam for Recovery and Backup</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/veeam-for-recovery-and-backup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/veeam-for-recovery-and-backup/</guid><description>We offer backup and recovery services for a number of clients inside our cloud infrastructure. Not all of them use the same software so I have had a chance to play with four different solutions for backup and recovery. Each solution has there strengths for sure, none of them are bad but some are stronger then others. The one I think works the most reliably is Veeam.
There are many places the highlight the benefits of Veeam for backing up or doing restores of VMware based infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Next Year Post Ideas</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</guid><description>Developers are rock stars. They are the people who push the hardware and systems to do things that we may never have though they could do. They design our websites, that game you play on your phone, the service that keeps track of all your calendar, contacts, and emails. They create things out of nothing through the multitude of languages that they have to learn to stay competitive. They are always pushing themselves to do more, be better, learn something, break something, and create something useful for others.</description></item><item><title>Respect your language</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/respect-your-language/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/respect-your-language/</guid><description>Before I take off for the rest of the week, I wanted to talk about something that I overheard during a conversation about development languages.
&amp;ldquo;I work in language &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo; because it is awesome. That other language sucks.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, ya? Well there is this other language that is worse then that, and those guys are elitist so they all suck.&amp;rdquo;
Let me ask, what is wrong with the statements above?</description></item><item><title>Commitmas</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/commitmas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/commitmas/</guid><description>With this journey into development, I have been exposed to many different tools that help developers create their code and manage that code.
IDE&amp;rsquo;s Package management tools Frameworks Repositories It&amp;rsquo;s this last one I really wanted to focus on. Repositories are places to hold your code as well as keep different versions of your code. These are tracked by who uploads the code, what has changed, and a complete history of what has changed.</description></item><item><title>Movember 2016</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/movember-2016/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/movember-2016/</guid><description>This post will be pretty short I think. I just wanted to touch upon Movember for mens health.
For the last three years I have participated in Movember to help raise awareness for mens health. The first year, it was really just a reason to grow a moustache really. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the cause very seriously and didn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate what the group was really trying to do. There are a few movements in November and I admit that I got caught up in the &amp;ldquo;everyone is doing it&amp;rdquo; thing.</description></item><item><title>Impostor Syndrome</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/impostor-syndrome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/impostor-syndrome/</guid><description>I wanted to talk about something that I have been dealing with for a while. As I have shifted from technology to technology or new philosophy, I always start off as someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like they belong. Like an impostor in that technologies environment. I&amp;rsquo;m getting that feeling right now as I try and break more into the developer space. There is a phrase called &amp;ldquo;Impostor Syndrome&amp;rdquo; that I felt was a perfect description of what I felt.</description></item><item><title>Chef on the Pi</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/chef-on-the-pi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/chef-on-the-pi/</guid><description>A few weeks back I decided to replace my older Raspberry Pi for a new Raspberry Pi 3. I had no idea what I wanted to do with this amazing board when I bought it, but I did know that I wanted to see if I could get it to bootstrap to my Chef server. This was a very interesting process and I wanted to go through all the steps for anyone else who may want to bootstrap their Raspberry Pi for whatever reason.</description></item><item><title>The Coolest Thing from Insight 2016 and What it Means for Your Job Security</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/the-coolest-thing-from-insight-2016-and-what-it-means-for-your-job-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/the-coolest-thing-from-insight-2016-and-what-it-means-for-your-job-security/</guid><description>There’s no denying that NetApp had a slew of shiny new toys to unveil at this year’s Insight conference in Las Vegas. There were the new AFF platforms, all the new functionality and features included in ONTAP 9, and the list goes on. But for me, the coolest thing I saw at Insight was not necessarily demonstrated on stage (although there was a cool presentation on it, which I’ll get into later).</description></item><item><title>Starting Projects</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/starting-projects/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/starting-projects/</guid><description>I got to my desk this morning and I looked really hard at my computer screen. I glanced at all the tabs that I had open for the different things that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to wrap my head around.
iOS - A huge motivator for me. Learning to develop for the Apple ecosystem has been a goal for many years. I spent a LOT of time this year working on that goal so I could get an app into the app store, but still not there yet.</description></item><item><title>Getting Setup</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/getting-setup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/getting-setup/</guid><description>After playing with this over the last few days, I really like the setup that I have found. This amazing {personal} theme I found really hits what I want in my layout. I&amp;rsquo;m not a great developer (working on that) so building my own blog platform wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I wanted to try and tackle when there were so many other options out there. This platform really works for what I want to do.</description></item><item><title>New Blog</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/new-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/new-blog/</guid><description>Just a quick update. I have a new home for my blog! I will be using the GitHub Pages feature and build off my GitHub account. I hope to have a custom URL at some point, but that is down the road. Enjoy the new home of my blog and maybe I can keep it up more! :wink:</description></item><item><title>Forecast Cloudy Intro</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/forecast-cloudy-intro/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/forecast-cloudy-intro/</guid><description>Since starting with iVision, I have been able to embed myself into their new cloud practice. It has exposed me to a bunch of new technologies that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an opportunity to play with before. Cloud has always been something that has interested me, especially so after Cisco announced their new cloud certification track. So this got me thinking&amp;hellip;how do I become a better cloud engineer? In order to be a better cloud engineer, I need a deeper understanding of cloud and how it really benefits customers.</description></item><item><title>NetApp Insight 2015</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/netapp-insight-2015/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/netapp-insight-2015/</guid><description>NetApp Insight was a few weeks ago in Las Vegas and it was a blast. I would have had something posted sooner, but I have been recovering from the information overload and Las Vegas just gets to you at some point. I picked up some kind of black plague that I thought was going to take me out, but I am on the mend and I want to do a recap of what Insight was for me.</description></item><item><title>ACI</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/aci/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/aci/</guid><description>I remember walking through Cisco Live last year in San Francisco and hearing all about ACI and the Cisco DevNet program. To be totally honest, I shrugged it off as just something that was trying to get hyped up and would not have any real impact on what I do.
Well&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;that has changed over the last year for me. What made it change? I guess a desire to learn and grow.</description></item><item><title>NetApp Insight 2014</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/netapp-insight-2014/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/netapp-insight-2014/</guid><description>Oh boy, what a week it has been. We just finished wrapping up NetApp Insight 2014 and it has been a blast! It was a whirlwind of information, learning, social activities, and hanging out with some AWESOME people. Oh, did I also mention how awesome the people were?
AWESOME!!
And when I say people, I mean everyone. This was the first year that the event was open to customers and the response was amazing.</description></item><item><title>Confessions of a NetApp Advocate</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/confessions-of-a-netapp-advocate/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2014 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/confessions-of-a-netapp-advocate/</guid><description>My name is Jesse, and I’m a NetApp Advocate. What does it mean to be a NetApp Advocate? It means I talk about NetApp so much someone at NetApp noticed and gave me a title. My company is a relatively new NetApp partner, so I actually find myself in the interesting position of advocating for NetApp not only with our customers, but with our internal teams as well.
Everyone always wants to know why I like NetApp so much.</description></item><item><title>Cisco Live 2014</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/cisco-live-2014/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2014 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/cisco-live-2014/</guid><description>Well, I survived my first trip to Cisco Live. What an amazing show for sure. But I have to say I was a little overwhelmed with the amount of people and in some cases the amount of information. There were over 25,000 people out at Live this year and all of them were looking to get the most of of their trip. What was interesting about live is the depth of people that go out there.</description></item></channel></rss>
