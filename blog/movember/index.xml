I just wanted to touch upon Movember for mens health.
For the last three years I have participated in Movember to help raise awareness for mens health. The first year, it was really just a reason to grow a moustache really.

There are a few movements in November and I admit that I got caught up in the &amp;ldquo;everyone is doing it&amp;rdquo; thing.</description></item></channel></rss>
