The last couple of years I have just lost motivation and direction. I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of floated through doing my job and not really building skills as deeply as I once did. So, with the new year here and me trying to work on my motivation I&amp;rsquo;m going to start a new series. I&amp;rsquo;m going to call it Starting Flutter!</description></item><item><title>Next Year Post Ideas</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</guid><description>So, I wrote done some ideas for the year. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with a few topics to help get myself back into things. These should keep me pretty busy over the next few months.
These should give me a few months worth of materials to work on. But let me get into why I am looking at these specifically.
It&amp;rsquo;s been seven or so months since Apple released SwiftUI on us and I&amp;rsquo;ve only done a little bit with this framework.</description></item><item><title>Let us build a button</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/let-us-build-a-button/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/let-us-build-a-button/</guid><description>Creating buttons in Xcode is pretty simple. You go into interface builder, you select the button, you drag it over and drop it into the storyboard, and then you connect it to the ViewController as an Outlet or an IBAction. Not a lot to it right? Well, what if you need to make a button but don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the Main.Storyboard?
It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty simple to add a button into your app by creating one and either dropping in into your UIView or adding it to a StackView.</description></item><item><title>Hackathon01</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/hackathon01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/hackathon01/</guid><description>What a great weekend I had. This last Saturday (2 Dec. 2017) I participated in my first Hackathon! I have to say it was an eye opening experience and one that I really want to do again. Let me give a breakdown of the day that I had.
My First Hackathon The event started at 9am so I arrived at ~8:30am just to make sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t late and could get settled and all of that.</description></item><item><title>Keeping On</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/keeping-on/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2017 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/keeping-on/</guid><description>Ok, I&amp;rsquo;ve been really quiet for a LONG time. My last post was in way back in February and I feel bad about that. I had been doing so good at posting pretty consistently towards the end of last year and then I just dropped off. I&amp;rsquo;m sure some people (not many people I don&amp;rsquo;t think) are wondering what happened to me? Where did I go? What did I do?</description></item><item><title>Next Year Post Ideas</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/next-year-post-ideas/</guid><description>Developers are rock stars. They are the people who push the hardware and systems to do things that we may never have though they could do. They design our websites, that game you play on your phone, the service that keeps track of all your calendar, contacts, and emails. They create things out of nothing through the multitude of languages that they have to learn to stay competitive. They are always pushing themselves to do more, be better, learn something, break something, and create something useful for others.</description></item><item><title>Respect your language</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/respect-your-language/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/respect-your-language/</guid><description>Before I take off for the rest of the week, I wanted to talk about something that I overheard during a conversation about development languages.
&amp;ldquo;I work in language &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo; because it is awesome. That other language sucks.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, ya? Well there is this other language that is worse then that, and those guys are elitist so they all suck.&amp;rdquo;
Let me ask, what is wrong with the statements above?</description></item><item><title>Commitmas</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/commitmas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/commitmas/</guid><description>With this journey into development, I have been exposed to many different tools that help developers create their code and manage that code.
IDE&amp;rsquo;s Package management tools Frameworks Repositories It&amp;rsquo;s this last one I really wanted to focus on. Repositories are places to hold your code as well as keep different versions of your code. These are tracked by who uploads the code, what has changed, and a complete history of what has changed.</description></item><item><title>Impostor Syndrome</title><link>http://jessecanderson.dev/impostor-syndrome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2016 21:27:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://jessecanderson.dev/impostor-syndrome/</guid><description>I wanted to talk about something that I have been dealing with for a while. As I have shifted from technology to technology or new philosophy, I always start off as someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like they belong. Like an impostor in that technologies environment. I&amp;rsquo;m getting that feeling right now as I try and break more into the developer space. There is a phrase called &amp;ldquo;Impostor Syndrome&amp;rdquo; that I felt was a perfect description of what I felt.</description></item></channel></rss>
