It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote anything new, and I do apologize for that. December what a busy month and then January and I think I actually burned myself out a bit with all that I was trying to do. I would spend my days working on our cloud deployment process and on-boarding customers or ingesting customer data onto our NetApp arrays. I was building out DR testing plans and scripts to use for each customers DR test and validating it worked. Then at night I was spending time with family, working on learning Swift/Ruby/Rails, or trying to learn more with Chef. In the end, I think I took on to much and my brain melted a little bit. But&mldr;.I&rsquo;ve taken some time this month and I&rsquo;m feeling a bit better. I plan on taking some much needed time off after we get through this latest push of on-boarding a customer to really get my head back into the game, but I am feeling better now.</p><p>So, where does this leave us? I&rsquo;ve got 8 drafts in my draft folder here to work through and clean up. But first, some announcements!</p><p>I got the email Monday, Jan 30th that I was officially accepted into the Veeam Vangaurd program. What does this mean? Well, I&rsquo;ve been working with Veeam for the last year and really see a benefit to the system. I&rsquo;ve posted a cheesy post before about how I think Veeam is a pretty awesome platform, but I really want to expand on that. I&rsquo;m working on something with some really smart people that I hope will really make a positive impact. I won&rsquo;t talk to much to it yet, but I will in another post as we finish or get closer to finishing. Very exciting stuff. But other then that project, I do want to do more Veeam posts anyway and hopefully show how great it is and how cool the integrations with NetApp are. More to come over the year, they are doing cool things and I can&rsquo;t wait to talk more about it. Especially how it fits with the cloud stuff!</p><p>I&rsquo;m still working on my &ldquo;developer&rdquo; title with Ruby and Swift. Chef is still an important milestone at work and we are looking forward to moving forward with a full Chef deployment. But I really need to find a balance between learning different technologies. Due to work requirements, I think I&rsquo;m going to focus more on Ruby/Rails (Why not, they go hand in hand) and take a break from the iOS dev stuff. When I get a solid foundation to build cookbooks on then maybe grab iOS again.</p><p>Speaking of iOS, I did create an app! It&rsquo;s not in the app store just yet, but I may throw it up there if I can finish doing the main icon for it. I&rsquo;m very excited that I was able to complete that though. I was running my own code and it compiled. Yet, I still don&rsquo;t feel comfortable in Swift or Ruby to call myself a developer. LOL, funny how that works. {Not an impostor, I promise!}</p><p>Ok, enough of an update. Just know that I am still here and I am still working on cool things. I&rsquo;m building on what I&rsquo;ve learned and I have met some really sharp people who are helping me pull off something really cool. Stay tuned, it&rsquo;s going to be a great year!</p></content><p><a href=http://jessecanderson.dev/blog/update/>#update</a>
