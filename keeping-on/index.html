My last post was in way back in February and I feel bad about that. I had been doing so good at posting pretty consistently towards the end of last year and then I just dropped off. I&rsquo;m sure some people (not many people I don&rsquo;t think) are wondering what happened to me? Where did I go? What did I do?</p><p>So here is the deal&mldr;&mldr;.I ran away and now live in an evil lair under an active volcano and I&rsquo;m plotting world domination.</p><p>Well, not really. I didn&rsquo;t run away and I didn&rsquo;t move into an evil lair under an active volcano. That would be pretty cool if I did though. And I won&rsquo;t actually comment on if I&rsquo;m plotting world domination or not. I leave that up to you to decide.</p><p>But I have made some big changes in what I&rsquo;m doing and the direction that I&rsquo;m kind of going in life. These are all GREAT changes and I&rsquo;ve been very happy with the changes I&rsquo;ve made.</p><p>As you may recall, I was working for iVision as a &lsquo;Cloud Engineer&rsquo; and even though the direction was the right one for me, the work wasn&rsquo;t as rewarding as I had hoped. I wasn&rsquo;t really doing &lsquo;Cloud&rsquo; like I wanted to. So I was taking it on myself to learn cloud. I was learning the concepts and the technologies behind the various public and private cloud offerings. This lead me to finding a job posting from AWS which I applied for mostly on a whim. I didn&rsquo;t really expect it to go anywhere when I first sent my resume off to them and figured I had a better chance at the NetApp position I was applying for as well.</p><p>Fast forward a few months and here I am working for AWS as a Solutions Architect. Did that really just happen?? Yes it did and I&rsquo;m very glad for it. It has been an amazing few months here and being able to dive into these technologies and get with customers to try and help relieve pain points with them has been so much fun. I&rsquo;ve been heads down learning about the technologies that we offer and it just blows my mind at the pace of innovation within this company. Even with so many employees here, it moves at the speed of a startup most days and there is a feeling (as well as the saying that everyone knows) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always day one at Amazon&rdquo;.</p><p>I&rsquo;m very thankful for this opportunity to help make a positive impact with people. I&rsquo;m thankful for the ability to grow my skills as well, which is a huge thing for me as I always like to be challenged and keep learning new things.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to start posting again soon. Keep in mind that this blog is mine, and it&rsquo;s not official from AWS or anything. But I want to do some learning posts on things that I&rsquo;ve really been digging into over the last few months and some cool things that we offer that may help people somewhere.</p><p>So stay tuned, reach out if you have any questions, and keep learning. Between the AWS Cloud learning and iOS stuff I&rsquo;ve still been doing, I have ideas for posts and content that I can&rsquo;t wait to share.</p><p>Thanks for sticking with me. Keep on keeping on!</p></content><p><a href=http://jessecanderson.dev/blog/career/>#career</a>
