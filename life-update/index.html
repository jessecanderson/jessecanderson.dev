So here we go!</p><p>We are very close to our inital launch of an application written native in iOS and Android. I built out the iOS application and my office mate built out the Android application. It was a LOT of fun to build these out, and I learned a bunch while building it. I think this sets us up for adding some cool features in the near future. I want to add in biometrics into the application, that was a future feature that I was working on in the Xamarin version.</p><p>We have two other mobile applications that we are working on. One is written in Xamarin and needs to be rewritten into native application code, and the other is a concept that we have to build out by August. So, that is going to be a HUGE application that we are going to build out. I have some of it done already, but there is so much more to do.</p><p>With all of this, I&rsquo;ve learned a ton and even used some cool new Swift 5.0 features like the Result() type! That was a fun refactor. I hope to get some neat iOS specific blogs up in the next month, I know a bunch of people online already have Result() blogs and videos but I wanted to try and get one up myself. I also wanted to go through how I build our network layer. I created our own network layer and didn&rsquo;t use a framework like AlamoFire. With URLSession() it&rsquo;s pretty strait forward to build out a network layer. The tricky part was getting Codable and Realm Object to work in the same class. I found a few good blog posts, but I learned ab out Coding Keys and the Decodable protocol while doing it.</p><p>Few things I know I need to work on:</p><p>I&rsquo;m hoping I can get into some of these items and write up some posts on them in the next few months. But we have to see how much time I get to work on blog stuff.</p><p>I did migrate over to a new domain, so that is cool. I was able to secure <a href=https://www.jessecanders.dev>www.jessecanders.dev</a> and this blog will now live there. It&rsquo;s still hosted by GitHub Pages, but even that is on the fence of how long I want to leave it here. We just have to wait and see.</p><p>I hope you all out there are doing great, keep on being awesome and building cool things!</p></content><p><a href=http://jessecanderson.dev/blog/personal/>#personal</a>
